## Motivation
My motivation for this project was to create a simple quiz game. On completetion of the quiz it should ask for the players name or intials. Then a score table shows up displaying the highscores and if the player scored in the top five it will show their name/intials in it cordening postiion.
## Problems
my problem with this project has been localStorage and figuring out how to set up a key. How coukd i describe my issue well I know how to use it and set one key up to hold the username and total score,as for what I am missing is making it save each time a person plays annd the drawing on previous information. I can input the information into the the table. and the problem im expecting to run into is the reordering of the total scores but I think I might just be making it harder then it is by overthinking
## What I learned
THis may sound crazy to a degree but one think i distinctly take away from this project was being able to nest function within another function.Inputing into the html from the javascript, using create element; append, appendChild. the specfic varaition I still have to go over some more but i think i have the basic of it down.
