## Motivation
 My motivation for this project was to create a simple quiz game. On completetion of the quiz it should ask for the players name or intials. Then a score table shows up displaying the highscores and if the player scored in the top five it will show their name/intials in it cordening postiion.
## Problems
 My problem with this project has been localStorage and figuring out how to set up a key. How coukd i describe my issue well I know how to use it and set one key up to hold the username and total score,as for what I am missing is making it save each time a person plays annd the drawing on previous information. I can input the information into the the table. and the problem im expecting to run into is the reordering of the total scores but I think I might just be making it harder then it is by overthinking. Like I can picture what I what I want it to do; but I'm so unsure of how to go about implentng things the trial and error method takes up alot of time.
## What I learned
 This may sound crazy to a degree but one take way I distinctly take away from this project was being able to nest function within another function.Inputing into the html from the javascript, using create element; append, appendChild. the specfic varaition I still have to go over some more but I think I have the basic of it down. 
## Standout 
 Apologize I'm not sure how to say what stands out I havent completed what I wanted to present. once I am I'll be sure to adjust different aspects off the CSS if I make any changes possiblely the HTML but JS wewll that once I geet the way I wanted tweaking it to fit the CSS and HTML adjustments will be a simple task(I'll knock on for myself)
